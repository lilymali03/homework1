What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge preserves the histories of both the original branch and the working 
branch, while the rebase rewrites the history of one branch. A merge allows 
programmers to see individual snapshots from the original and working branch
once they are merged. A rebase rewrites some of the history as one linear
timeline, although it is cleaner.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository the server that Github uses to store the code. When you clone
the repository to your computer and edit it, you are using a local repository.
